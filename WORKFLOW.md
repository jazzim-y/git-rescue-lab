# Git Rescue Lab - Workflow

## Task 1: Bisect Finding
Bad Commit Hash: c99fb42
Explanation: The bug was caused because the code was checking the length of the items array (number of distinct products) instead of calculating the total quantity of items in the cart.

## Task 6: Workflow Questions

1. Branching Strategy Recommendation
For a small team of 4, I recommend [GitHub Flow / Git Flow / Trunk-based]. I chose this because [insert your reason, e.g., it is simple, keeps the main branch deployable, and avoids merge hell for small teams].

2. Removing the Secret from History
To completely erase the `.env` file from all past commits, we would need to use a tool like `git filter-repo` or the older `git filter-branch`. This assignment didn't require that step because [insert reason, e.g., it aggressively rewrites the entire repository history, which is dangerous and can break the repository for other teammates if not coordinated perfectly].

3. Rewriting History
It was acceptable to rewrite history in Task 2 because the "asdf" commit was only on my local machine. It would NOT be acceptable to rewrite a commit my teammates had already pulled because [insert reason, e.g., changing a commit creates a brand new hash. If teammates already have the old hash, pushing the new one creates divergent timelines and massive merge conflicts, like the error we just saw!].
